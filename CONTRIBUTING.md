# How to Contribute

We welcome community contributions! Here's how to get started:

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Join Our Discord (Highly Recommended)**: For the best experience and to stay updated on discussions, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/MsF24qUA5y). Most of our discussions, collaboration, and support happen here. You can ping a moderator for the developer role to get started.

2. **Fork the Repository**: Identify the relevant repository and fork it to your own GitHub account.

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your work. If you're assigned to a specific task, follow any naming conventions we use.

4. **Make Your Changes**: Work on your task. Collaborate with others on the same branch if needed.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once youâ€™re done, submit a pull request (PR) to the development branch if it exists; otherwise, PR to the main branch. This helps manage merge conflicts and streamlines the review process.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Existing Issues**: Look to see if your issue has already been reported.
2. **Report a New Issue**: If not, create a detailed issue in the appropriate GitHub repository or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/MsF23qUA5y).
3. **Label Your Issue**: Use the correct labels to categorize it for the right team.
