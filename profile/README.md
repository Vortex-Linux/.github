# VoyageLinux

## Overview

**VoyageLinux** is a groundbreaking Linux distribution designed for maximum security, flexibility, and stability. By seamlessly integrating containers and virtual machines (VMs).VoyageLinux offers a unique, immutable, and atomic operating system that caters to the needs of both novice and advanced users.

## Key Features

- **Immutable and Atomic**: VoyageLinux ensures system integrity and reliability by maintaining an immutable base system, allowing for atomic updates and rollbacks. We provide maximum integration with the base system using `ship` in a way that nearly nothing needs to be installed in the base system, ensuring you don't have to worry about system breakage as long as you have multiple VMs or containers ready in case one fails.
- **Seamless Integration**: Utilize containers and virtual machines to install and manage packages, providing isolation and flexibility. Even the kernel used to boot the system can be installed in a container, and you can even boot into a VM.
- **Security First**: Designed with security in mind, VoyageLinux leverages advanced security measures to protect your system and data. You can choose to be more secure by using various options within `ship`, which can help isolate even USB devices and network connections.
